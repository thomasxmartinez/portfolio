#USERSTORIES
1. As a USER, I want to make sure that I can see the contact information to get in touch with the person who runs the portfolio.
2. As a USER, I want to see the projects that person has worked on.
3. As a USER, I want to be able to navigate to each section freely.
4. As a USER, I want the option to make all images clickable and go to the correct directory.
5. As a USER, I want to make sure the site is viewable on multiple platforms.
6. As a USER, I want links to all directories such as linkedin, email, social.
7. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
    This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
    Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
    You can use 'data-' attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
    Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
8. As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
